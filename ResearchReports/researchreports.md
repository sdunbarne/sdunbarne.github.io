Reports about population analysis and population deviations from
ideal in Nebraska Legislative Districts.

## What If Nebraska Had Two Congressional Districts?

I was asked what would
happen if Nebraska was reduced to two Congressional Districts in the
next census and redistricting cycle in 2030.  That was a great
question, and I decided to investigate.  This is a short report on
some quick experiments in response to that question.

## Population Deviation in the 2021 Nebraska Legislative Redistricting

Conclusions from Analysis of the Adopted Redistricting Map

    The adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006,
    sponsored by Sen. Linehan, has an evident pattern of
    over-populating urban Legislative Districts with more residents,
    within the allowable 5% population deviation from the ideal
    district population of 40,031. Correspondingly, rural districts in
    the adopted Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, show a
    pattern of fewer residents, within the allowable 5% population
    deviation. The allowable district population deviation value of 5%
    is set by Legislative Resolution 134 to be in accord with other
    redistricting criteria, e.g. district boundary lines should
    coincide with boundaries of cities and villages.

    Statistical analysis of the adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting
    plan, LEG21-39006, sponsored by Sen. Linehan, shows a /definite
    correlation of district population deviation with population
    density/. The statistical analysis also shows the overall trend of
    district population deviation versus population density is
    stronger than alternatives.

    Advanced statistical analysis and comparison with 30,000
    alternative redistricting maps show that the adopted 2021
    Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, is more extreme in
    over-populating urban districts than 99% of alternatives.

## Population Deviations in the 2024 Nebraska Legislative Districts

Population distribution changes since 2021 have magnified the
malapportionment between urban and rural Nebraska Legislative
Districts present in the 2021 legislative redistricting.  According to
the most recent Census Bureau population estimates, 22 of 25 urban
districts are over equal apportionment while 16 of 24 rural districts
are under equal apportionment.

Population distribution changes since 2021 have changed the equal
apportionment among the 3 congressional districts to unequal
apportionment with District 1 and and District 2 approaching the
allowable +2% deviation from equal apportionment.

The goal of this summary is to call attention to the malapportionment
between urban and rural Nebraska Legislative Districts present in the
2021 legislative redistricting which is now becoming even more
pronounced.  The motive behind the report is to promote proactive
equality and fairness in any further redistricting, including the next
scheduled cycle in 2030 and even before.
