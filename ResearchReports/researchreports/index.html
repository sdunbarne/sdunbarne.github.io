Dunbar, Ph.D.</strong></p> <code>sdunbarne@gmail.com</code> <h1>Reports</h1> <p>Reports about population analysis and population deviations from ideal in Nebraska Legislative Districts.</p> <h2>What If Nebraska Had Two Congressional Districts?</h2> <p>I was asked what would happen if Nebraska was reduced to two Congressional Districts in the next census and redistricting cycle in 2030. That was a great question, and I decided to investigate. This is a short report on some quick experiments in response to that question.</p> <a href="../twocongressionaldistricts.pdf" download>What If Nebraska Had Two Congressional Districts </a> <h2 id=population_deviation_in_the_2021_nebraska_legislative_redistricting ><a href="#population_deviation_in_the_2021_nebraska_legislative_redistricting" class=header-anchor >Population Deviation in the 2021 Nebraska Legislative Redistricting</a></h2> <p>Conclusions from Analysis of the Adopted Redistricting Map</p> <p>The adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, sponsored by Sen. Linehan, has an evident pattern of over-populating urban Legislative Districts with more residents, within the allowable 5&#37; population deviation from the ideal district population of 40,031. Correspondingly, rural districts in the adopted Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, show a pattern of fewer residents, within the allowable 5&#37; population deviation. The allowable district population deviation value of 5&#37; is set by Legislative Resolution 134 to be in accord with other redistricting criteria, e.g. district boundary lines should coincide with boundaries of cities and villages. Statistical analysis of the adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, sponsored by Sen. Linehan, shows a /definite correlation of district population deviation with population density/. The statistical analysis also shows the overall trend of district population deviation versus population density is stronger than alternatives. Advanced statistical analysis and comparison with 30,000 alternative redistricting maps show that the adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, is more extreme in over-populating urban districts than 99&#37; of alternatives.</p> <a href="../analysis_population_deviations.pdf" download>2021 Legislative District Population Deviations </a> <h2 id=population_deviations_in_the_2024_nebraska_legislative_districts ><a href="#population_deviations_in_the_2024_nebraska_legislative_districts" class=header-anchor >Population Deviations in the 2024 Nebraska Legislative Districts</a></h2> <p>Population distribution changes since 2021 have magnified the malapportionment between urban and rural Nebraska Legislative Districts present in the 2021 legislative redistricting. According to the most recent Census Bureau population estimates, 22 of 25 urban districts are over equal apportionment while 16 of 24 rural districts are under equal apportionment.</p> <p>Population distribution changes since 2021 have changed the equal apportionment among the 3 congressional districts to unequal apportionment with District 1 and and District 2 approaching the allowable &#43;2&#37; deviation from equal apportionment.</p> <p>The goal of this summary is to call attention to the malapportionment between urban and rural Nebraska Legislative Districts present in the 2021 legislative redistricting which is now becoming even more pronounced. The motive behind the report is to promote proactive equality and fairness in any further redistricting, including the next scheduled cycle in 2030 and even before.</p> <a href="../nebraska_analysis_summary_May2024.pdf" download>2024 Legislative District Population Deviations </a> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Steven Dunbar.
