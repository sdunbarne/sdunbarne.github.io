# Introduction

A fundamental principle in redistricting is that districts have equal
populations; a map that does not adhere to this is called
*malapportioned*. In Reynolds v. Sims, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that
state legislative districts must have close to equal populations.

The key argument was the "equal protection under the law" clause of the
14th Amendment. The ideal of "one person, one vote" is now embedded in
state constitutions and legislative resolutions.

A simple example illustrates why malapportionment violates "equal
protection under the law". Imagine a state with a population of 30
people, divided into 2 legislative districts, call them A and B, each
with 1 legislative representative. The ideal division would be for each
district to have a population of 15. But suppose the state were
malapportioned into District A with population 10 and District B with
population 20. Then the population in District A would have twice the
representational power as the population in District B.

In the September 12, 2022 Lincoln Journal Star, just before the
Redistricting Special Session of the Legislature began, political
reporter and columnist Don Walton quoted David Drozd, research
coordinator for the Center for Public Affairs Research at the University
of Nebraska at Omaha, in response to a question posed by Legislative
Sen. John McCollister of Omaha. "The Big 3 counties of Douglas,
Lancaster and Sarpy are due 27.4 seats (56 percent of 49), up from the
25.8 in the 2010 census (52.6 percent of 49). So that's a shift of 1.6
seats". In the October 4, 2022
Lincoln Journal Star summarizing the Redistricting Special Session Don
Walton wrote "Census figures pointed to the need to add an additional
1.6 urban senators to the Legislature and rural lawmakers swiftly
rounded off that figure to one. That was their Priority No. 1 and they
succeeded". In the same article,
Walton quoted Nebraska Farm Bureau President Mark McHargue, who was
pleased with the Legislature's redistricting results. "We recognize
there is an ongoing shift in population in our state from rural to urban
population centers," he said. "With that in mind, our ask of the
Legislature in the redistricting process was for the body to recognize
the importance of maintaining rural voices in this effort, given the
vital role agriculture and rural Nebraska play in our state." However,
Section 5 of the Legislative Resolution 134 giving guidelines for the
redistricting process says: "District boundaries shall not be
established with the intention of favoring a political party or any
other group or person."

This analysis reveals malapportionment in the legislative districts
adopted in Nebraska's 2021 redistricting process and how it was
accomplished. Although the adopted map stayed within the allowable
deviations of populations of districts, the statistical analysis here
shows the deviations have a strong pattern of giving less
representational power to urban districts and more representational
power to rural districts.

# What Do We Expect To Accomplish With This Report?

We expect that this report will show that:

-   Nebraska's 2021 redistricting process was rushed, without due
    consideration for alternatives,
-   the outcome was flawed, in that it resulted in malapportionment,
-   now is the time to establish an independent redistricting commission
    which can consider maps in an open, and deliberate way free from
    outside influences.

# Does this report show gerrymandering?

Gerrymandering is a loaded and explosive term, usually associated with
partisan political advantage. This report provides evidence that the
Nebraska's 2021 redistricting process achieved a "careful crafting" of
legislative districts to achieve a hidden goal to give more
representational power to rural legislative districts which is
inconsistent with the stated goals of LR 134 to not advantage or favor
any group.

# Conclusions from Analysis of the Adopted Redistricting Map

1.  The adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006,
    sponsored by Sen. Linehan, has an *evident pattern of over-populating urban
    Legislative Districts* with more residents, within the allowable 5%
    population deviation from the ideal district population of 40,031.
    Correspondingly, rural districts in the adopted Legislative
    redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, show a pattern of fewer residents,
    within the allowable 5% population deviation. The allowable district
    population deviation value of 5% is set by Legislative Resolution
    134 to be in accord with other redistricting criteria, e.g. district
    boundary lines should coincide with boundaries of cities and
    villages.

2.  Statistical analysis of the adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting
    plan, LEG21-39006, sponsored by Sen. Linehan, shows a /definite
    correlation of district population deviation with population
    density/. The statistical analysis also shows the overall trend of
    district population deviation versus population density is stronger
    than alternatives. 

3.  Advanced statistical analysis and comparison with
    30,000 alternative redistricting maps show that the adopted 2021
    Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, is *more extreme* in
    over-populating urban districts than 99% of alternatives.

This analysis was undertaken on our own initiative, motivated by our
interest in the application of mathematics, data science, statistics,
and information technology to public policy and good government. This
research and analysis was not sponsored or funded by any organization or
individual. All of the research was carried out on personally owned
computers using open-source software.

We wish to thank the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group for
sponsoring a series of conferences on mathematical analysis of
gerrymandering that we individually attended at our own expense. We also
wish to thank the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group for creating
the `GerryChainJulia` software.
