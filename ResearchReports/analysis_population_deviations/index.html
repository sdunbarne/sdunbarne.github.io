Dunbar, Ph.D. and Kristin Pfabe, Ph.D.</strong></p> <code>sdunbarne@gmail.com</code> <h1 id=download ><a href="#download" class=header-anchor >Download</a></h1> <a href="../analysis_population_deviations.pdf" download> Analysis of Population Deviations </a> full report in PDF format. The report contains all figures, references, and code. <h1 id=introduction ><a href="#introduction" class=header-anchor >Introduction</a></h1> <p>A fundamental principle in redistricting is that districts have equal populations; a map that does not adhere to this is called <em>malapportioned</em>. In Reynolds v. Sims, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state legislative districts must have close to equal populations.</p> <p>The key argument was the &quot;equal protection under the law&quot; clause of the 14th Amendment. The ideal of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; is now embedded in state constitutions and legislative resolutions.</p> <p>A simple example illustrates why malapportionment violates &quot;equal protection under the law&quot;. Imagine a state with a population of 30 people, divided into 2 legislative districts, call them A and B, each with 1 legislative representative. The ideal division would be for each district to have a population of 15. But suppose the state were malapportioned into District A with population 10 and District B with population 20. Then the population in District A would have twice the representational power as the population in District B.</p> <p>In the September 12, 2022 Lincoln Journal Star, just before the Redistricting Special Session of the Legislature began, political reporter and columnist Don Walton quoted David Drozd, research coordinator for the Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, in response to a question posed by Legislative Sen. John McCollister of Omaha. &quot;The Big 3 counties of Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy are due 27.4 seats &#40;56 percent of 49&#41;, up from the 25.8 in the 2010 census &#40;52.6 percent of 49&#41;. So that&#39;s a shift of 1.6 seats&quot;. In the October 4, 2022 Lincoln Journal Star summarizing the Redistricting Special Session Don Walton wrote &quot;Census figures pointed to the need to add an additional 1.6 urban senators to the Legislature and rural lawmakers swiftly rounded off that figure to one. That was their Priority No. 1 and they succeeded&quot;. In the same article, Walton quoted Nebraska Farm Bureau President Mark McHargue, who was pleased with the Legislature&#39;s redistricting results. &quot;We recognize there is an ongoing shift in population in our state from rural to urban population centers,&quot; he said. &quot;With that in mind, our ask of the Legislature in the redistricting process was for the body to recognize the importance of maintaining rural voices in this effort, given the vital role agriculture and rural Nebraska play in our state.&quot; However, Section 5 of the Legislative Resolution 134 giving guidelines for the redistricting process says: &quot;District boundaries shall not be established with the intention of favoring a political party or any other group or person.&quot;</p> <p>This analysis reveals malapportionment in the legislative districts adopted in Nebraska&#39;s 2021 redistricting process and how it was accomplished. Although the adopted map stayed within the allowable deviations of populations of districts, the statistical analysis here shows the deviations have a strong pattern of giving less representational power to urban districts and more representational power to rural districts.</p> <h1 id=what_do_we_expect_to_accomplish_with_this_report ><a href="#what_do_we_expect_to_accomplish_with_this_report" class=header-anchor >What Do We Expect To Accomplish With This Report?</a></h1> <p>We expect that this report will show that:</p> <ul> <li><p>Nebraska&#39;s 2021 redistricting process was rushed, without due consideration for alternatives,</p> <li><p>the outcome was flawed, in that it resulted in malapportionment,</p> <li><p>now is the time to establish an independent redistricting commission which can consider maps in an open, and deliberate way free from outside influences.</p> </ul> <h1 id=does_this_report_show_gerrymandering ><a href="#does_this_report_show_gerrymandering" class=header-anchor >Does this report show gerrymandering?</a></h1> <p>Gerrymandering is a loaded and explosive term, usually associated with partisan political advantage. This report provides evidence that the Nebraska&#39;s 2021 redistricting process achieved a &quot;careful crafting&quot; of legislative districts to achieve a hidden goal to give more representational power to rural legislative districts which is inconsistent with the stated goals of LR 134 to not advantage or favor any group.</p> <h1 id=conclusions_from_analysis_of_the_adopted_redistricting_map ><a href="#conclusions_from_analysis_of_the_adopted_redistricting_map" class=header-anchor >Conclusions from Analysis of the Adopted Redistricting Map</a></h1> <ol> <li><p>The adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, sponsored by Sen. Linehan, has an <em>evident pattern of over-populating urban Legislative Districts</em> with more residents, within the allowable 5&#37; population deviation from the ideal district population of 40,031. Correspondingly, rural districts in the adopted Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, show a pattern of fewer residents, within the allowable 5&#37; population deviation. The allowable district population deviation value of 5&#37; is set by Legislative Resolution 134 to be in accord with other redistricting criteria, e.g. district boundary lines should coincide with boundaries of cities and villages.</p> <li><p>Statistical analysis of the adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, sponsored by Sen. Linehan, shows a /definite correlation of district population deviation with population density/. The statistical analysis also shows the overall trend of district population deviation versus population density is stronger than alternatives. </p> <li><p>Advanced statistical analysis and comparison with 30,000 alternative redistricting maps show that the adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, is <em>more extreme</em> in over-populating urban districts than 99&#37; of alternatives. </p> </ol> <h1 id=acknowledgments ><a href="#acknowledgments" class=header-anchor >Acknowledgments</a></h1> <p>This analysis was undertaken on our own initiative, motivated by our interest in the application of mathematics, data science, statistics, and information technology to public policy and good government.
