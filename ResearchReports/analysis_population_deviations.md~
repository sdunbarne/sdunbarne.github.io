# Introduction

A fundamental principle in redistricting is that districts have equal
populations; a map that does not adhere to this is called
*malapportioned*. In Reynolds v. Sims, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that
state legislative districts must have close to equal populations.

The key argument was the "equal protection under the law" clause of the
14th Amendment. The ideal of "one person, one vote" is now embedded in
state constitutions and legislative resolutions.

A simple example illustrates why malapportionment violates "equal
protection under the law". Imagine a state with a population of 30
people, divdied into 2 legislative districts, call them A and B, each
with 1 legislative representative. The ideal division would be for each
district to have a population of 15. But suppose the state were
malapportioned into District A with population 10 and District B with
population 20. Then the population in District A would have twice the
representational power as the population in District B.

In the September 12, 2022 Lincoln Journal Star, just before the
Redistricting Special Session of the Legislature began, political
reporter and columnist Don Walton quoted David Drozd, research
coordinator for the Center for Public Affairs Research at the University
of Nebraska at Omaha, in response to a question posed by Legislative
Sen. John McCollister of Omaha. "The Big 3 counties of Douglas,
Lancaster and Sarpy are due 27.4 seats (56 percent of 49), up from the
25.8 in the 2010 census (52.6 percent of 49). So that's a shift of 1.6
seats" cite{waltonsep12}. In the October 4, 2022
Lincoln Journal Star summarizing the Redistricting Special Session Don
Walton wrote "Census figures pointed to the need to add an additional
1.6 urban senators to the Legislature and rural lawmakers swiftly
rounded off that figure to one. That was their Priority No. 1 and they
succeeded" cite{waltonsoct4}. In the same article,
Walton quoted Nebraska Farm Bureau President Mark McHargue, who was
pleased with the Legislature's redistricting results. "We recognize
there is an ongoing shift in population in our state from rural to urban
population centers," he said. "With that in mind, our ask of the
Legislature in the redistricting process was for the body to recognize
the importance of maintaining rural voices in this effort, given the
vital role agriculture and rural Nebraska play in our state." However,
Section 5 of the Legislative Resolution 134 giving guidelines for the
resdistricting process says: "District boundaries shall not be
established with the intention of favoring a political party or any
other group or person." cite{legislature21}.

This analysis reveals malapportionment in the legislative districts
adopted in Nebraska's 2021 redistricting process and how it was
accomplished. Although the adopted map stayed within the allowable
deviations of populations of districts, the statistical analysis here
shows the deviations have a strong pattern of giving less
representational power to urban districts and more representational
power to rural districts.

Sections 2 and 3 present the conclusions with supporting graphics.
Sections 4 and 5 present the supporting work for the conclusions.
Section 6 gives the authors' qualifications and notes that this study
was not supported by any organization or individual.

# What Do We Expect To Accomplish With This Report?

We expect that this report will show that:

-   Nebraska's 2021 redistricting process was rushed, without due
    consideration for alternatives,
-   the outcome was flawed, in that it resulted in malapportionment,
-   now is the time to establish an indepedent redistricting commision
    which can consider maps in an open, and deliberate way free from
    outside influences.

# Does this report show gerrymandering?

Gerrymandering is a loaded and explosive term, usually assocaiated with
partisan political advantage. This report provides evidence that the
Nebraska's 2021 redistricting process achieved a "careful crafting" of
legislative districts to achieve a hidden goal to give more
representational power to rural legislative districts which is
inconsistent with the stated goals of LR 134 to not advantage or favor
any group.

# Conclusions from Analysis of the Adopted Redistricting Map

1.  The adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006,
    sponsored

    by Sen. Linehan, has an *evident pattern of over-populating urban
    Legislative Districts* with more residents, within the allowable 5%
    population deviation from the ideal district population of 40,031.
    Correspondingly, rural districts in the adopted Legislative
    redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, show a pattern of fewer residents,
    within the allowable 5% population deviation. The allowable district
    population deviation value of 5% is set by Legislative Resolution
    134 to be in accord with other redistricting criteria, e.g. district
    boundary lines should coincide with boundaries of cities and
    villages.

    Figure ref:fig:linehan-39006 shows the map of 2021 Legislative
    Districts colored by population deviation, the orange districts
    showing populations above equal population and the purple districts
    showing populations below the ideal population. The orange districts
    cluster in the urban centers of Omaha and Lincoln, while the purple
    districts cover the rest of the state. (We chose these colors to
    avoid political connotations and to use best color practices for
    cartography.) An interactive version of the map allowing zooming and
    panning, and labeled with exact population deviation values is at
    <https://kristie3.github.io/#rural-and-urban-comparison-legislative-maps>,
    in the tab labeled 2021.

    deviation, while orange represents positive
    deviation.](./deviation_leg21_39006.png "linehan-39006")

2.  Statistical analysis of the adopted 2021 Legislative redistricting

    plan, LEG21-39006, sponsored by Sen. Linehan, shows a /definite
    correlation of district population deviation with population
    density/. The statistical analysis also shows the overall trend of
    district population deviation versus population density is stronger
    than alternatives. See Figure
    ref:fig:scatter-plot-compare-deviation-density.

    best-fit lines of population deviation versus population density for
    proposed and adopted redistricting
    maps.](./scatter_plot_deviation_density.png "scatter-plot-deviation-density")

3.  Advanced statistical analysis and comparison with

    30,000 alternative redistricting maps show that the adopted 2021
    Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39006, is *more extreme* in
    over-populating urban districts than 99% of alternatives. See Figure
    ref:fig:hist-corrs-2021.

    line.](./histogram_corrs_leg21_39006.png "hist-corrs-2021")

# Comparative Conclusions from Analysis of Proposed Maps

1.  Sen. Linehan's first proposed 2021 Legislative redistricting plan, LEG21-39001,
    which was not adopted but was later modified, shows an *even more
    pronounced pattern* of over-populating urban Legislative Districts
    with more residents, within the allowable 5% population deviation.
    Correspondingly, rural districts in Sen. Linehan's first
    Legislative redistricting plan LEG21-39001 show a pattern of fewer
    residents within allowable population deviation. See Figure
    ref:fig:linehan-39001. An interactive version of the map allowing
    zooming, panning and labeled with population deviation values is at
    <https://kristie3.github.io/#rural-and-urban-comparison-legislative-maps>.
    in the tab labeled Linehan.

    Districts, colored by deviation from ideal; purple represents a
    negative deviation, while orange represents positive
    deviation.](./deviation_leg21_39001.png "linehan-39001")

2.  Advanced statistical analysis and comparison with

    30,000 alternative maps indicate that the original Legislative
    redistricting plan, LEG21-39001, sponsored by Sen. Linehan was *even
    more extreme* in over-populating urban districts that 99.6% of
    alternatives.

3.  In contrast, Sen. Wayne's

    proposed, but not adopted, redistricting plan, LEG21-13001, shows
    *no pattern* of greater or lesser population deviation from ideal
    for urban or rural districts. See Figure ref:fig:wayne-13001. An
    interactive version of the map allowing zooming, panning and labeled
    with exact population deviation values is at
    <https://kristie3.github.io/#rural-and-urban-comparison-legislative-maps>.
    in the tab labeled Wayne.

    Districts, colored by deviation from ideal; purple represents a
    negative deviation, while orange represents positive
    deviation.](./deviation_leg21_13001.png "wayne-13001")

4.  Advanced statistical analysis and comparison with

    30,000 alternative maps indicate that the defeated Legislative
    redistricting plan (LB13-001 sponsored by Sen. Wayne) was *neither
    extreme nor unusual* in over-populating urban districts.

5.  Advanced statistical analysis of the 2011 Legislative Districts

    using 2010 population data show that in comparison with 10,000
    alternative maps that the adopted 2011 plan was *neither extreme nor
    unusual* in over-populating urban districts. See Figure
    ref:fig:fig:hist-labels-corr-2011 .

# Analysis of the Adopted Redistricting Map

1.  The analysis of the adopted 2021 legislative redistricting map uses
    the shapefile

    `LEG21-39006.zip` provided by the Legislative Research Office, see
    <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hH4Y_g2CkPJz-PbusfNEhXO4_uI-x820/view?usp=sharing>.
    Using this shapefile with the code in the Code Section creates
    Figure ref:fig:linehan-39006. The legislative districts are colored
    by the percentage of population deviation from the ideal population
    of 40,031 residents per district. Purple indicates the district is
    under ideal population and orange indicates over ideal population.
    The intensity of the color indicates the magnitude of deviation,
    with a greater deviation having a more intense color. This
    legislative district map shows most of the orange districts
    intersect the major urban areas of Omaha and Lincoln. The purple
    districts are in the rural parts of the state. An evident pattern of
    consistently over-populating most of the urban Legislative Districts
    with more residents, within the allowable 5% population deviation,
    is apparent in Figure ref:fig:linehan-39006. An interactive version
    of the map allowing zooming and panning, and labeled with population
    deviation values is at
    <https://kristie3.github.io/#rural-and-urban-comparison-legislative-maps>.
    in the tab labeled 2021.

    A revealing statistical evaluation of the pattern is the following.
    Calculate the population density, in persons per square mile, of
    each district. Create a scatterplot of percent deviation from ideal
    versus population density. For the 49 Legislative districts,
    population density ranges from about 6 persons per square mile to
    over 6000 persons per square mile. Because the density ranges over 3
    orders of magnitude, using this direct density is inconvenient, so
    instead use the base-10 logarithm of the population density. The
    logarithm has a range approximately 0 to 4.

    Each Legislative district has an ideal equal population of 40,031
    persons. Because of the difficulty of drawing legislative districts
    with exactly this number of persons, the law allows up to a 5%
    allowable deviation from ideal,
    cite{legislature99}, cite{legislature21}. The deviation of
    population is a percentage deviation from ideal for each district.
    Over the 49 districts, this is in the allowable range of
    $ \pm 5 \% $. This is comparable in magnitude to the base-10
    logarithm of the population density. Both the logarithm of density
    and percent deviation are at a convenient scale for graphing and
    analysis.

    A scatter plot of the percent deviation (vertical scale) versus the
    logarithm of the population density (horizontal scale) is in Figure
    ref:fig:scatter-plot-deviation-density. The broad Census Bureau
    definition of "urban" is census units with a population density of
    at least 1000 persons per square mile,
    [cite:&census94](cite:&census94). Hence, this analysis classifies
    districts with a population density greater than 1000 residents per
    square mile (logarithm is greater than 3) as urban. The analysis
    classifies remaining districts as rural. Points representing urban
    districts are orange, points representing rural districts are
    purple. The dividing line in population density is a vertical dashed
    line at 3, urban to the right, rural to the left. The dividing line
    in population deviation is a horizontal dashed line at 0. The best
    fit regression line, or trend line, is the thick black line.

    ![label:fig:scatter-plot-deviation-density Scatter plot of deviation
    versus density for all districts for the adopted 2021 LEG21-39006
    maps.](./scatter_deviation_logdensity_leg21_39006.png "scatter-plot-deviation-density")

    The clustering of points and the trend line on the scatter plot
    shows relationships among the points. At the simplest level, 15 of
    21 districts classified as urban have positive percent deviation,
    that is, have greater than ideal population size. Those 15 districts
    are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 20, 26, 29, and 31. See
    Table ref:tab:over-populated-districts for more detail about those
    districts. All of the legislative districts in Douglas County have
    positive deviation but some districts are not classified as urban by
    this definition because they contain large tracts of agricultural,
    industrial or infrastructure (e.g. Eppley Airport). An example is
    District 13.

    On the other hand, half of the 28 districts classified as rural are
    below ideal population, and half are above ideal population. To
    quantify this trend we use two statistical measures. The first is
    the Pearson correlation coefficient, or just the correlation for
    short. The correlation for deviation-versus-density for the final
    2021 districts is $r = 0.315$. The correlation between the
    transformed data of percent deviation versus logarithm of density
    $r = 0.436$. These are positive, indicating increasing deviation
    with increasing population density. (The transformation to the
    logarithm of population density affects the value of the
    correlation. However, scaling the 2 sets of data to the same
    magnitudes does not affect the positive association.) The size of
    the positive correlation is better understood in comparison to other
    proposed redistricting maps. The comparison appears later in this
    report. However, the correlation already shows that increasing
    population density is associated with greater deviation from ideal.
    That is, the plan tends to pack urban districts with more residents.

    The second measure of relationship is the slope of the best-fit line
    through the scatter plot. The slope for the best-fit line through
    the final 2021 deviation-versus-density scatter plot is
    $4.733 \times 10^{-6}$. This slope is very small in magnitude
    because the rise in deviations only changes by about $0.1$ while the
    run, the change in magnitude of the density, is about 6000.
    Nevertheless, the slope is positive. The slope for the best-fit line
    through the final 2021 percent deviation versus logarithm of
    population density scatter plot is $1.098$ which is easier to
    interpret, justifying the transformation of variables. The important
    aspect of both is that the slope of the trend line is positive. Here
    again, the size of the positive slope is better understood in
    comparison to other proposed redistricting maps, the comparison
    appears below.

    Even before comparison, a fundamental observation is: The
    correlation and the slope are positive, indicating the trend that
    districts with greater population density also have over-population
    deviation from ideal. Correspondingly, districts with lesser
    population density also have under population deviation from ideal.

2.  Advanced statistical analysis using `GerryChainJulia`.

    In her opinion for Rucho v. Common Cause
    [cite:&rucho18:](cite:&rucho18:) Supreme Court Justice Kagan says
    "today's mapmakers can generate thousands of possibilities at the
    touch of a key and then choose the one giving their party maximum
    advantage" but "the same technologies and data that ... facilitate
    ... gerrymanders also enable courts to discover them".
    Mathematicians and computer scientists have developed scientific
    tools to detect and measure gerrymandering.

    `GerryChainJulia` is an open-source program specifically designed to
    statistically sample and evaluate alternative redistricting maps.
    The article
    [cite:&DeFord2021Recombination](cite:&DeFord2021Recombination)
    documents and evaluates the algorithms implemented in
    `GerryChainJulia` in more general terms. The code repository
    [cite:&gerrychain-julia-4649464](cite:&gerrychain-julia-4649464)
    documents the code for `GerryChainJulia`, written in the very fast
    and modern mathematical programming language Julia developed at MIT.
    Briefly, `GerryChainJulia` makes a sequence of random changes,
    called a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, to a given redistricting
    plan. The changes create a new set of valid districts at each step.
    The `GerryChainJulia` program evaluates characteristics of the
    individual districts and of the entire redistricting plan at each
    step. In our use of `GerryChainJulia`, the characteristics we
    evaluated were the population density of each generated district and
    the population deviation from ideal of each generated district. The
    program calculates correlation of the population deviation and the
    population density for each alternative redistricting plan created
    at each step. The result is a sequence of correlation values for
    alternative redistrictings that can be statistically compared to the
    correlation value for the adopted 2021 LEG21-39006.

    The larger in magnitude a correlation between two variables is, the
    stronger is the relationship between the variables. To evaluate how
    unusual a strong correlation value of the original redistricting is
    with respect to randomly generated comparative values, we rank the
    correlation among all the alternatives. If the ranking of the
    particular redistricting correlation, is in say, the 99th percentile
    among all alternatives we call it an *outlier*. There is some chance
    an evaluation of a correlation as an outlier can occur because of
    the random nature of the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. A
    mathematical theorem in
    [cite:&doi:10.1080/2330443X.2020.1806763](cite:&doi:10.1080/2330443X.2020.1806763)
    shows that under conditions satisfied by the Markov Chain Monte
    Carlo method, the probability that an unusual redistricting
    occurring at the 99th percentile has about a 2% chance of occurring.
    In other words, observing by chance a redistricting which is unusual
    in this degree of correlation is a rare event. It is not expected by
    chance alone to see such a degree of correlation among a group of
    valid redistrictings. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe the
    unusual nature of the correlation occurs for some reason other than
    chance.

    We ran the `GerryChainJulia` program with 2 parallel chains of
    15,000 steps for a combined total of 30,000 alternative
    redistrictings to evaluate for correlation. Recall that the final
    2021 LEG21-39006 had a positive correlation value of 0.315. Ranking
    this positive correlation for the adopted 2021 LEG21-39006 against
    30,000 alternative maps, the correlation of the adopted map was at
    the 99.64 percentile. The mathematical theorem cited above predicts
    that among all similar runs, a percentile this large would occur
    about only 0.7% of the time. That is, the degree of correlation of
    the final 2021 redistricting LEG21-39006 compared to 30,000 randomly
    created alternatives makes it reasonable to believe the unusual
    nature of the correlation occurs for some reason other than chance.
    See Figure ref:fig:hist-corrs-2021.

    Similar results occurred in shorter testing runs done earlier:

    -   Comparing the adopted 2021 LEG21-39006 correlation to 10,000
        correlations from two parallel chains of 5,000 steps each
        resulted in the adopted map correlation at the 99.4 percentile
        with a probability of about 1.3% of occurring.

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   Comparing the adopted 2021 LEG21-39006 correlation to 20,000
        correlations from two parallel chains of 10,000 steps each
        resulted in the adopted map correlation at the 99.1 percentile
        with a probability of about 1.8% of occurring.

    This tells us that `GerryChainJulia` worked consistently.

    Summarizing the results of these experiments in redistricting, a
    redistricting map having a correlation value at the 99th percentile
    or greater has less than a 2% probability of occurring solely by
    chance.

3.  To determine if this degree of correlation is unusual

    among other redistricting plans, in the next section we make
    analogous comparisons with the 2011 maps and with other proposed
    redistricting plans considered in the September 2021 Special Session
    of the Nebraska Legislature.

# Analysis of Proposed Maps

1.  Comparative Analysis of Sen. Linehan's First Proposed 2021
    Legislative Redistricting plan (LEG21-39001),

    1.  Sen. Linehan's first proposed 2021 legislative redistricting
        plan

        LEG21-39001 was not adopted, the Legislature amended it into the
        final plan. This first proposed redistricting plan LEG21-39001
        shows an *even more pronounced pattern* of over-populating urban
        Legislative Districts, within the allowable 5% population
        deviation.

        The analysis of the adopted 2021 map uses the shapefile provided
        by the Legislative Research Office, originally downloaded from
        the Redistricting Committee's website. The shapefile is no
        longer available on the Redistricting Committee website.
        However, the shapefile accompanies the source material for this
        report. Using this information creates Figure
        ref:fig:linehan-39001. An interactive version of the map
        allowing zooming, panning and labeled with population deviation
        values is at
        <https://kristie3.github.io/#rural-and-urban-comparison-legislative-maps>.
        in the tab labeled Linehan. This map shows the even more
        pronounced pattern of consistently over-populating most of the
        urban Legislative Districts with more residents. Most of the
        orange colored districts intersect the major urban areas of
        Omaha and Lincoln. The purple colored districts are in the rural
        parts of the state.

        The more numerical evaluation of the pattern follows the
        previous analysis. A scatter plot of the per-cent deviation
        (vertical scale) versus the (logarithm of) the density
        (horizontal scale) is in Figure
        ref:fig:scatter-plot-deviation-density-leg21-39001. Note that of
        20 districts classified as urban based 15 have positive
        deviation indicating greater than ideal population. On the other
        hand of 29 districts classified as rural, 19 have negative
        deviation and population less than ideal, while only 10 rural
        districts have greater than ideal population.

        map.](./scatter_deviation_logdensity_leg21_39001.png "scatter-plot-deviation-density-leg21-39001")

        The Pearson correlation coefficient for deviation-versus-density
        for the adopted 2021 districts is $r =
            0.550$ indicating an *even stronger* relationship between
        density and deviation than before. In terms of the transformed
        variable of percent deviation versus logarithm of population
        density the correlation coefficient is $0.626$ compared to the
        previous value of $0.436$.

        The second measure of relationship is the slope of the best-fit
        line through the scatter plot. The slope for the best-fit line
        through Linehan's proposed 2021 raw deviation versus density
        scatter plot is $8.86 \times 10^{-6}$ which is greater than the
        slope of the adopted plan, indicating an even stronger trend for
        denser districts to be over-populated. In terms of the
        transformed variable of percent deviation versus logarithm of
        population density the best-fit line slope is $1.651$, greater
        than the previous value of $1.06$. This comparison can be seen
        easily in Figure ref:fig:scatter-plot-deviation-density.

    2.  We also did the advanced statistical analysis on Sen. Linehan's

        first proposed map, again using the open source program
        `GerryChainJulia`. Once again the program makes a sequence of
        random changes to the starting redistricting plan LEG21-39001,
        creating a new valid set of districts at each step. The program
        evaluates characteristics of each district and of the entire
        redistricting plan at each step. As before, the characteristics
        we evaluated were the population density of each district and
        the population deviation from ideal of each district. The
        correlation of the population deviation and the population
        density can then be calculated for each created alternative
        redistricting. The result is a sequence of correlation values
        for alternative redistrictings that to compare to the
        correlation value for the adopted 2021 LEG21-39006.

        We ran the `GerryChainJulia` program for two parallel chains
        with 2 parallel chains of 15,000 steps for a combined total of
        30,000 alternative redistricting to evaluate. Recall that the
        first proposed 2021 LEG21-39001 had a positive correlation value
        of 0.550. Ranking this positive correlation for the first
        proposed 2021 LEG21-39001 against 30,000 alternative maps, the
        correlation of the adopted map was at the 99.64 percentile. The
        mathematical theorem predicts that among all similar runs
        percentile this large has only about 0.7% probability of
        occurring solely by chance. This demonstrates the Sen.
        Linehan's first proposed map had an even greater association of
        higher density districts with over-population which is
        unreasonable to attribute to chance.

2.  We used Sen. Wayne's proposed map LEG21-13001 to compare with

    Sen. Linehan's first proposed 2021 LEG21-3001 and final legislative
    redistricting plans LEG21-39006. The analysis of the map uses the
    shapefile provided by the Legislative Research Office. The shapefile
    is no longer available on the Redistricting Committee website. Using
    this information creates Figure ref:fig:wayne-13001. This map shows
    no apparent pattern of orange or purple districts appearing in
    either rural or urban areas. The distribution appears to be random.
    An interactive version of the map allowing zooming, panning and
    labeled with population deviation values is at
    <https://kristie3.github.io/#rural-and-urban-comparison-legislative-maps>.
    in the tab labeled Wayne.

    Statistical evaluation of the pattern follows the previous analyses.
    A scatter plot of the percent deviation (vertical scale) versus the
    logarithm of the density (horizontal scale) is in Figure
    ref:fig:scatter-deviation-logdensity-leg21-13001. Of 22 districts
    classified as urban, 12 have positive deviation and 10 have negative
    deviation. Of 27 districts classified as rural, 14 have positive
    deviation and 13 have negative deviation. The Pearson correlation
    coefficient for the raw deviation-versus-density for the final 2021
    districts is $r =
        0.112$ indicating a weak relationship between density and
    deviation. The Pearson correlation coefficient for percent deviation
    versus logarithm of density for the Wayne district proposal is
    $r = 0.067$ indicating virtually no relationship between density and
    deviation. The second measure of relationship is the slope of the
    best-fit line through the scatter plot. The slope for the best-fit
    line through the Wayne's proposed 2021 percent deviation versus
    logarithm of density scatter plot is $0.3058$ indicating essentially
    only a weak trend between density and deviation. For deviation
    versus density, the best-fit slope is $0$ to significant digits.

    proposed 2021 LEG21-13001
    maps.](./scatter_deviation_logdensity_leg21_13001.png "scatter-deviation-logdensity-leg21-13001")

    1.  We also did the advanced statistical analysis on Sen. Wayne's
        proposed redistricting.

        Again we ran the `GerryChainJulia` program for two parallel
        chains with 2 parallel chains of 15,000 steps for a combined
        total of 30,000 alternative redistricting to evaluate. Ranking
        the correlation value for Sen. Wayne's proposed map against
        30,000 alternative maps, the correlation of the proposed map was
        at the 85th percentile. The mathematical theorem predicts that
        among all similar runs, a percentile this large would occur
        about 31% of the time. These ranking indicate that the
        correlation in Sen. Wayne's map is *neither extreme nor
        unusual* with respect to these measures.

3.  Advanced statistical analysis of the 2011 Legislative Districts.

    The correlation of deviation with density for the 2011 redistricting
    plan was 0.0454. Using the scaled values of percent population
    deviation versus logarithm of population density, the correlation
    was 0.028. This is essentially no correlation, in contrast to the
    correlations in the 2021 LEG21-39006 plan.

    We did the advanced statistical analysis with `GerryChainJulia` as
    we did for the final 2021 plan but with a slight difference. The
    2010 Census data shapefile has 193,352 Census Blocks compared to the
    2020 Census data files with 119,103 Census Blocks. (It is not known
    to us why the number of 2010 Census Blocks is 62% larger than the
    number of 2020 Census Blocks. However, many of the 2010 Census
    Blocks had zero population so perhaps the Census Bureau consolidated
    blocks so that most have non-zero population.) The larger number of
    Census Blocks prevented running two parallel chains in the memory on
    available computers, so we ran the single chain test
    [cite:&chikina2860](cite:&chikina2860) with 10,000 steps using 2010
    population data. This gave a comparison of the correlation of
    percent deviation versus logarithm of population density with 10,000
    alternative maps. The result is that the correlation of percent
    deviation with logarithm of population density for the 2011
    redistricting was at the 50.4 percentile with a chance of about
    99.56% of occurring at that percentile or greater among comparable
    runs of the chain. The conclusion is that the adopted 2011 plan was
    *neither extreme nor unusual* in packing population into urban
    districts.
