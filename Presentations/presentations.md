# Presentations

## Solving and Simulating Stochastic Differential Equations

A talk given in the UNL Probability Seminar on November 12, 2024.
This talk presents graphical and numerical interpretations of Brownian
motion and Stochastic Differential Equations, along with algorithms
for solving SDEs with error estimates.  It conclude with numerical
examples of simulating the SDEs presented by Prof. Yamazaki previously
in the seminar. Several of the slides refer to the Lecture Notes by
item number.
