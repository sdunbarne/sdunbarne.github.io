# Exercise 1

Consider the following code:

``` example
x = [1, 2]
y = x
y[1] = 10
x[1]
```

What is the value of `x[1]` and why?

1.  My Answer:

    ``` {.julia eval="yes" results="output" exports="both"}
    x = [1, 2]
    y = x
    y[1] = 10
    x[1]
    ```

    ``` example
    10
    ```

    The value `x[1] = 10`, and `x = [10,2]`. The reason is because in
    assignment, Julia does not copy to an additional memory location, it
    is a pointer to the same memory location. So modifying `y` also
    modifies `x`.

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    `x[1]` will be `10` because `y = x` is not copying data but it binds
    the same value both to variable `x` and `y`.

3.  Commentary:

    The answers are the same, but Kaminski\'s is more succinct.

# Exercise 2

How can you type `⚡ = 1`? Check if this operation succeeds and what is
its result.

1.  My Answer:

    This succeeds, but only if I type the exact sequence `\:zap:<tab>`

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    In help mode (activated by `?`) copy-paste `⚡` to get:

    ``` example
    help?> ⚡
    "⚡" can be typed by \:zap:<tab>
    ```

    After the `⚡ = 1` operation a new variable `⚡` is defined and it
    is bound to value `1`.

# Exercise 3

What will be the value of variable `x` after running of the following
code and why?

``` example
x = 0.0
for i in 1:7_000_000
    global x += 1/7
end
x /= 1_000_000
```

1.  My Answer:

    I initially guess the result will be true, because of
    round-off/truncation error. In fact, that is the case.

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer

    `x` will have value `0.9999999999242748`. This value is below `1.0`
    because representation of `1/7` using `Float64` type is less than
    rational number 1/7, and the error accumulates when we do addition
    multiple times.

    **Extra**: You can check that indeed that `Float64` representation
    is a bit less than rational 1/7 by increasing the precision of
    computations using the `big` function:

    ``` example
    julia> big(1/7) # convert Floa64 to high-precision float
    0.142857142857142849212692681248881854116916656494140625

    julia> 1/big(7) # construct high-precision float directly
    0.1428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428568
    ```

    As you can see there is a difference at 17th place after decimal dot
    where we have `4` vs `5`.

# Exercise 4

Express the type `Matrix{Bool}` using `Array` type.

1.  My Answer:

    `Matrix{Bool}` is an alias for `Array{Bool}[2,2]`, so not sure how
    to further express this matrix.

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    It is `Array{Bool, 2}`. You immediately get this information in
    REPL:

    ``` example
    julia> Matrix{Bool}
    Matrix{Bool} (alias for Array{Bool, 2})
    ```

# Exercise 5

Let `x` be a vector. Write code that prints an error if `x` is empty
(has zero elements).

1.  My Answer:

    ``` {.julia eval="yes" results="output" exports="both"}
    x = []
    if length(x) == 0
           throw(ArgumentError("x is empty vector"))
    end
    ```

    ```
    #+begin_example html
    ```
    ```
    #+end_example
    ```
    Note: The `throw()` function and `ArgumentError()` functions are
    introduced in Chapter 3.

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:.

    You can do it like this:

    ``` example
    length(x) == 0 && println("x is empty")
    ```

    **Extra**: Typically in such case one would use the `isempty`
    function and throw an exception instead of just printing information
    (here I assume that `x` was passed as an argument to the function):

    ``` example
    isempty(x) && throw(ArgumentError("x is not allowed to be empty"))
    #+end_src

    ** Commentary
    Note that Kaminski uses the very colloquial Julia construction of ~&&~ for the conditional.

    * Exercise 6
    Write a function called ~exec~ that takes two values ~x~ and ~y~ and a function
    accepting two arguments, call it ~op~ and returns ~op(x, y)~. Make ~+~ to be
    the default value of ~op~.

    ** My Answer:

    #+begin_src julia :results output :exports both
    function exec(x,y,op=+) return op(x,y) end
    exec(2,3)
    exec(2,3,*)
    exec(2,3,^)
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : exec (generic function with 2 methods)
    : 5
    : 6
    : 8

    ** Kaminski's Answer:
    Here are two ways to define the ~exec~ function:
    #+attr_html: :textarea t :width 70
    #+begin_example
    exec1(x, y, op=+) = op(x, y)
    exec2(x, y; op=+) = op(x, y)
    ```

    The first of them uses positional arguments, and the second a
    keyword argument. Here is a difference in how they would be called:

    ``` example

    julia> exec1(2, 3, *)
    6

    julia> exec2(2, 3; op=*)
    6
    ```

3.  Commentary:

    I am using the positional notation, see below. The keyword notation
    would be preferable, I think.

# Exercise 7

Write a function that calculates a sum of absolute values of values
stored in a collection passed to it.

1.  My Answer:

    ``` {.julia eval="yes" results="output" exports="both"}
    abssum(x) = sum(abs, x)
    abssum([1,-2,3])
    m = [1 0; 0 1]
    abssum(m)
    ```

    ``` example
    abssum (generic function with 1 method)
    6
    2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
     1  0
     0  1
    2
    ```

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    Such a function can be written as:

    ``` example
    sumabs(x) = sum(abs, x)
    ```

3.  Commentary:

    Kaminski\'s solution is identical to mine except for the name of the
    function.

# Exercise 8

Write a function that swaps first and last element in an array in place.

1.  My Answer

    ``` {.julia eval="yes" results="output" exports="both"}
    function swapFirstLast!(x)
       f = x[1]
       x[1] = x[end]
       x[end] = f
       return x
    end
    ```

    This is adapted from Kaminski\'s solution. Note the Exclamation ! to
    emphasize the vector is changed in place. Note also the return
    statement.

2.  Kaminski\'s Solution:

    This can be written for example as:

    ``` example
    function swap!(x)
        f = x[1]
        x[1] = x[end]
        x[end] = f
        return x
    end
    ```

    **Extra** A more advanced way to write this function would be:

    ``` example
    function swap!(x)
        if length(x) > 1
            x[begin], x[end] = x[end], x[begin]
        end
        return x
    end
    ```

    Note the differences in the code:

    -   we use `begin` instead of `1` to get the first element. This is
        a safer practice since some collections in Julia do not use
        1-based indexing (in practice you are not likely to see them, so
        this comment is most relevant for package developers)
    -   if there are `0` or `1` element in the collection the function
        does not do anything (depending on the context we might want to
        throw an error instead)
    -   in `x[begin], x[end] = x[end], x[begin]` we perform two
        assignments at the same time to avoid having to use a temporary
        variable `f` (this operation is technically called tuple
        destructuring; we discuss it in later chapters of the book)

# Exercise 9

Write a loop in global scope that calculates the sum of cubes of numbers
from `1` to `10^6`. Next use the `sum` function to perform the same
computation. What is the difference in timing of these operations?

1.  My Answer:

    ``` {.julia eval="yes" results="output" exports="both"}
    function sumcubes1(n)
         s = 0
         for i=1:n
             s += i^3
         end
         return s
    end

    sumcubes2(n) = sum( (1:n).^3 )
    sumcubes3(n) = sum(x -> x^3, 1:n)
    ```

    ``` example
    julia> using BenchmarkTools

    julia> @btime sumcubes1(10^6)
      3.776 ns (0 allocations: 0 bytes)
    -8222430735553051648

    julia> @btime sumcubes2(10^6)
      5.266 ms (2 allocations: 7.63 MiB)
    -8222430735553051648

    julia> @btime sumcubes3(10^6)
      27.389 μs (0 allocations: 0 bytes)
    -8222430735553051648
    ```

# Exercise 10

Explain the value of the result of summation obtained in exercise 9.

1.  My Answer:

    Since the result is going to be on the order of
    $(10^6)^4 = 10^{24} > (2^3)^{24} = 2^{72}$ it is obvious that an
    Int64 overflow is going to occur.

2.  Kaminski\'s Solution:

    If you are working with numbers larger that can be stored in `Int`
    type, which is:

    ``` example
    julia> typemax(Int)
    9223372036854775807
    ```

    use `big` numbers that we discussed in **Exercise 3**:

    ``` example
    julia> @time sum(x -> big(x)^3, 1:10^6)
      0.833234 seconds (11.05 M allocations: 236.113 MiB, 23.77% gc time, 2.63% compilation time)
    250000500000250000000000
    ```

    Now we get a correct result, at the cost of slower computation.
