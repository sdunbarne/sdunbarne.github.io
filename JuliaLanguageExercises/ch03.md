# Exercise 1

Check what methods does the `repeat` function have. Are they all covered
in help for this function?

1.  My Answer:

    ``` {.julia results="output" exports="both"}
    methods(repeat)
    ```

    ``` example
    # 7 methods for generic function "repeat" from Base:
     [1] repeat(s::String, r::Union{Int128, Int16, Int32, Int64, Int8, UInt128, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt8})
         @ strings/substring.jl:260
     [2] repeat(s::Union{SubString{String}, String}, r::Integer)
         @ strings/substring.jl:262
     [3] repeat(c::Char, r::Union{Int128, Int16, Int32, Int64, Int8, UInt128, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt8})
         @ strings/string.jl:526
     [4] repeat(c::AbstractChar, r::Integer)
         @ strings/string.jl:540
     [5] repeat(s::AbstractString, r::Integer)
         @ strings/basic.jl:750
     [6] repeat(A::AbstractArray; inner, outer)
         @ abstractarraymath.jl:392
     [7] repeat(A::AbstractArray, counts...)
         @ abstractarraymath.jl:355
    ```

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    Now write `?repeat` and you will see that there are four entries in
    help. The reason is that for `Char` and `AbstractChar` as well as
    for `AbstractString` and `Union{SubString{String}, String}` there is
    one help entry.

    Why do these cases have two methods defined? The reason is
    performance. For example `repeat(c::AbstractChar, r::Integer)` is a
    generic function that accept any character values and
    `repeat(c::Char, r::Integer)` is its faster version that accepts
    values that have `Char` type only (and it is invoked by Julia if
    value of type `Char` is passed as an argument to `repeat`).

# Exercise 2

Write a function `fun2` that takes any vector and returns the difference
between the largest and the smallest element in this vector.

1.  My Answer:

    ``` {.julia results="output" exports="both"}
    fun2(v) = maximum(v) - minimum(v)
    fun2([1,2,3,4])
    fun2(rand(5))
    ```

    ``` example
    fun2 (generic function with 1 method)
    3
    0.5918024507455953
    ```

# Exercise 3

Generate a vector of one million random numbers from `[0, 1]` interval.
Check what is a faster way to get a maximum and minimum element in it.
One option is by using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions and the
other is by using the `extrema` function.

1.  My Answer:

    The size of the random vector is 10 here, since the all output from
    the source gets displayed, even with the semi-colon.

    ``` {.julia results="output" exports="both"}
    r = rand(10);
    @time [minimum(r), maximum(r)]
    @time extrema(r)
    @time [minimum(r), maximum(r)]
    @time extrema(r)
    ```

    ``` example
    10-element Vector{Float64}:
     0.09926978270388487
     0.1868386699426009
     0.606221722347162
     0.864219882712103
     0.7443558113081689
     0.12125787739574911
     0.4727686315226961
     0.24448772225092974
     0.6995123697355622
     0.1754085991101505
      0.207008 seconds (65.45 k allocations: 4.416 MiB, 13.64% gc time, 99.94% compilation time)
    2-element Vector{Float64}:
     0.09926978270388487
     0.864219882712103
      0.065342 seconds (29.55 k allocations: 1.987 MiB, 99.91% compilation time)
    (0.09926978270388487, 0.864219882712103)
      0.000022 seconds (3 allocations: 112 bytes)
    2-element Vector{Float64}:
     0.09926978270388487
     0.864219882712103
      0.000011 seconds (1 allocation: 32 bytes)
    (0.09926978270388487, 0.864219882712103)
    ```

    They are not too much different, but on my systems the `extrema(r)`
    seems to have an advantage.

    On gazelle, two successive applications show:

    ``` example
    julia> @time [minimum(r), maximum(r)]
      0.084783 seconds (73.06 k allocations: 4.823 MiB, 98.45% compilation time)
    2-element Vector{Float64}:
     1.3752756311546932e-7
     0.9999991479118671

    julia> @time extrema(r)
      0.059754 seconds (33.88 k allocations: 2.285 MiB, 96.34% compilation time)
    (1.3752756311546932e-7, 0.9999991479118671)

    julia> @time [minimum(r), maximum(r)]
      0.002908 seconds (3 allocations: 112 bytes)
    2-element Vector{Float64}:
     1.3752756311546932e-7
     0.9999991479118671

    julia> @time extrema(r)
      0.003839 seconds (1 allocation: 32 bytes)
    (1.3752756311546932e-7, 0.9999991479118671)
    ```

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    Kaminski reaches the same conclusion, but his values are more
    extreme.

# Exercise 4

Assume you have accidentally typed `+x = 1` when wanting to assign `1`
to variable `x`. What effects can this operation have?

1.  My Answer:

    ``` {.julia results="output" exports="both"}
    +x = 1
    ```

    ``` example
    + (generic function with 1 method)
    ```

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    If you earlier used addition in this Julia session then the
    operation will error. Start a fresh Julia session: If it is a fresh
    Julia session you define a new function in `Main` for `+` operator:
    This will also break any further uses of `+` in your programs:

# Exercise 5

What is the result of calling the `subtypes` on `Union{Bool, Missing}`
and why?

1.  My Answer:

    ``` {.julia results="output" exports="both"}
    subtypes(Union{Bool, Missing})
    ```

    ``` example
    Type[]
    ```

    From online documentation: `Core.Type` is an abstract type which has
    all type objects as its instances. The only instance of the
    singleton type `Core.Type{T}` is the object `T`.

    So I\'m guessing that Bool and Missing are at the bottom of types,
    so the only thing below them them is an array of Type.

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    The reason is that the `subtypes` function returns subtypes of
    explicitly declared types that have names (type of such types is
    `DataType` in Julia).

    **Extra** for this reason `subtypes` has a limited use. To check if
    one type is a subtype of some other type use the `<:` operator.

3.  Commentary:

    My experiment below illustrates this:

    ``` {.julia results="output" exports="both"}
    Bool <: Union{Bool, Missing}
    Missing <: Union{Bool, Missing}
    Int8 <: Union{Bool, Missing}
    ```

    ``` example
    true
    true
    false
    ```

# Exercise 6

Define two identical anonymous functions `x -> x + 1` in global scope?
Do they have the same type?

1.  My Answer:

    I\'m not sure what the question is asking: This is what I get:

    ``` {.julia results="output" exports="both"}
    x -> x + 1
    x -> x + 1
    ```

    ``` example
    #1 (generic function with 1 method)
    #3 (generic function with 1 method)
    ```

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    No, each of them has a different type:

        #+begin_example
        julia> f1 = x -> x + 1
        #1 (generic function with 1 method)

        julia> f2 = x -> x + 1
        #3 (generic function with 1 method)

        julia> typeof(f1)
        var"#1#2"

        julia> typeof(f2)
        var"#3#4"
        #+end_example

        This is the reason why function call like ~sum(x -> x^2, 1:10)~ in global
        scope triggers compilation each time.

        ** Commentary:

        I should have named the functions, then used the ~typeof()~ function.

        * Exercise 7

        Define the ~wrap~ function taking one argument ~i~ and returning the anonymous
        function ~x -> x + i~. Is the type of such anonymous function the same across
        calls to ~wrap~ function?

        ** My Answer:

        I get the same type on each call.
        #+begin_src julia :results output :exports both
        wrap(i) = x -> x + i
        wrap(1)
        typeof(wrap(1))
        typeof(wrap(2))
        typeof(wrap(3))

3.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    Julia defines a new type for such an anonymous function only once
    The consequence of this is that e.g. expressions inside a function
    like `sum(x -> x ^ i, 1:10)` where `i` is an argument to a function
    do not trigger compilation (as opposed to similar expressions in
    global scope, see exercise 6).

    ``` example
    julia> sumi(i) = sum(x -> x^i, 1:10)
    sumi (generic function with 1 method)

    julia> @time sumi(1)
      0.000004 seconds
    55

    julia> @time sumi(2)
      0.000001 seconds
    385

    julia> @time sumi(3)
      0.000003 seconds
    3025
    ```

# Exercise 8

You want to write a function that accepts any `Integer` except `Bool`
and returns the passed value. If `Bool` is passed an error should be
thrown.

1.  My Answer:

    No answer here.

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    We check subtypes of `Integer`:

    ``` example
    julia> subtypes(Integer)
    3-element Vector{Any}:
     Bool
     Signed
     Unsigned
    ```

    The first way to write such a function is then:

    ``` example
    fun1(i::Union{Signed, Unsigned}) = i
    ```

    and now we have:

    ``` example
    julia> fun1(1)
    1

    julia> fun1(true)
    ERROR: MethodError: no method matching fun1(::Bool)
    ```

    The second way is:

    ``` example
    fun2(i::Integer) = i
    fun2(::Bool) = throw(ArgumentError("Bool is not supported"))
    ```

    and now you have:

    ``` example
    julia> fun2(1)
    1

    julia> fun2(true)
    ERROR: ArgumentError: Bool is not supported
    ```

# Exercise 9

The `@time` macro measures time taken by an expression run and prints
it, but returns the value of the expression. The `@elapsed` macro works
differently - it does not print anything, but returns time taken to
evaluate an expression. Test the `@elapsed` macro by to see how long it
takes to shuffle a vector of one million floats. Use the `shuffle`
function from `Random` module.

1.  My Answer:

    Size of the input vector reduced here again since Org export prints
    the full vector in spite of the semi-colon.

    ``` {.julia results="output" exports="both"}
    using Random
    r = rand(10);
    @elapsed shuffle(r)
    @elapsed shuffle(r)
    ```

    ``` example
    10-element Vector{Float64}:
     0.01010684071612622

# Exercise 10

Using the `@btime` macro benchmark the time of calculating the sum of
one million random floats.

1.  My Answer:

    Size of the input vector reduced here again since Org export prints
    the full vector in spite of the semi-colon.

    ``` {.julia results="output" exports="both"}
    using BenchmarkTools
    r = rand(10);
    @btime sum(r)
    @btime sum(r)
    ```

    ``` example
    10-element Vector{Float64}:
     0.9819088788089474
     0.6452836754118338

      42.623 ns (1 allocation: 16 bytes)
    5.828444967160387
    ```

2.  Kaminski\'s Answer:

    ``` example
    julia> @btime sum(rand(10^6))
      1.644 ms (2 allocations: 7.63 MiB)
    500266.9457722128
    ```

    would be an incorrect timing as you would also measure the time of
    generating of the vector.
