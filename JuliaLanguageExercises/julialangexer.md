# Julia Language Exercises

## Julia for Data Analysis Addtional Exercises

A collection of HTML files containing the additional exercises from
/Julia for Data Analysis/ by Bogumil Kaminski, Manning, 2022 with my
answers, some answers from Kaminski, and my commentary on the
similarities and differences between the answers.  The HTML files are
exports from Emacs Org-Babel documents written in a roughly literate
programming fashion.  When I am confident the Org-Babel documents will run
completely and correctly under Julia I will publish them here also.
