## About me

![Steve Dunbar](/assets/IMG_20211006_110534319_HDR_cropped.jpg)

I am Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln. That means I'm officially retired, but I am still
active in research and writing. My mathematical interests are in the
intersection of dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and
mathematical modeling, especially applied to "nontraditional" areas
such as biology, finance, and political science. Most recently I am
interested in the application of Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods to
political redistricting. Those applications necessarily involve data
analysis, so I use R and Julia.
